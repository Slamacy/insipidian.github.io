                        <h1>The Thinking City VR [2020]</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Thinking City is designed to be a vertical slice of a conceptually larger single player VR game, intended to reflect the small scoped game demos distributed up to and during the 2000s. You play as a silent protagonist who enters the secret underground
                            city after receiving a mysterious invitation. On arrival, you find that the entire technological paradise has been abandoned, with no signs of life. You are greeted by an A.I. character named T.R.I.S.H. who guides you on a journey
                            to figure out the mystery of its downfall, and to restore prosperity to the now desolate underground metropolis. The game is primarily focused on delivering tone and atmosphere in its environment, as well as storytelling in its
                            non-player character dialogue and environmental detail.
                            <br><br> This vertical slice sees the player get trapped in a dingy, futuristic lab environment, patrolled by a seemingly possessed Service Robot that become alarmed
                            to any noticeable movement and sound. This part of the game takes place during the player's excursion into the Science District - one of the 4 main districts of the city. During this slice of gameplay the player will need to carefully
                            and tactically explore the lab environment, with the goal to restore full power to the facility and open the door to escape.
                            <br><br> You have little in the ways of defending yourself. Instead, you will need to manipulate the attention of their robot adversaries by throwing distractions and by moving carefully around the environment, hiding behind
                            objects or escaping through constantly opening & closing malfunctioning doors.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>The Thinking City was developed by myself and a team of 3 others for our DkIT Final Year Project.</b>

                        <p>
                            Gutbuster is a 3D FPS Platformer game inspired by the likes of Lovely Planet, where the player takes control of an anti-viral fighter with the mission to rummage through their host's guts and rid it of infestation.<br><br>
                            It is a simple game made while learning how to create witin the Microsoft XNA framework, where I implemented features such as vertex-object creation via factory class, object instanciation, menu & sound manager implementation, event systems, and batch update and draw calls among a couple of other things.<br><br>
                            The goal of the game is for the player to eliminate all red parasite enemies (mushroom and snake-like entities) then reach the end of the stage.<br><br>
                            While not very impressive artistically, I did learn quite a lot about team management, C# programming, and game specific programming conventions over the course of this project.<br><br>

                            Students who would stop at nothing to cheat are thirsty for blood!
                            Fight them off from all sides and try to get as far as you can to
                            gain a high score in accordance with the Fibonacci sequence. Miss an attack or get hit and the
                            sequence will reset, so keep your wits about you and act quickly! You've got that PhD for 
                            a reason, right?
                            <br><br>
                            This project was developed during an ERASMUS+ event in Łódź, Poland, in 2018 by a team of 6
                            students from different countries of origin. I worked with Dutch, Polish, Slovenian, French,
                            and Portugese students in order to design and prototype this fun mobile game incorporating
                            the cultural, historical, and visual artifacts decorating the City of Łódź.

                            After completing a run of Łódź of Pain, the player can submit their new high-score to online
                            leaderboards and compete with players around the world! [Currently Offline]
