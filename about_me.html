                <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
                <p>
                    To be succinct, I'm an artist and game developer who's always been fascinated with experiencing new and unique ways of storytelling. Whether it be through character design, gameplay elements, or the framing in art and comics / manga.
                    <br><br>
                    Since I was a child I was always fascinated by the adventures depicted in the games, anime, and cartoons I was exposed to. The journey a character goes through to grow and fulfil their goals, as well the people they met along their way, filled me with this intense awe and wimsy - Especially in films like The Black Couldron, and series like DragonBall or JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Over the years this feeling slowly turned into a desire to create my own stories, so when I entered Secondary School in 2011 my heart was set on working in a creative field.
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated from Dundalk Institute of Technology in 2020 with a Bachelor's in Computing in Games Development degree, achieving a First Class Honours after 4 years with my final year project - <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsrR80teRA" target="_blank">The Thinking City</a>. Over the course of my studies I learned many of the fundamentals of software development, software design, character design, game theory, and I have been exposed to and used a variety of different programming languages.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently I fill my time looking to find work to put my IT skills to good use, drawing digital and traditional artworks to expand my portfolio and explore interesting ideas, writing game design documents, and researching technologies that I may find worth exploring in the near future.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently based in Ireland, which I hope to remember as my starting point some day. In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed the site I spent time making!
